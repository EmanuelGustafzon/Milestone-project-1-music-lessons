  ## User Expereince

  - At first it was hard to press the right social media icon in the footer. I fixed this by adding more padding. 
  - By having the nav fixed to the top of the page it made it easier for the users to navigate throughout the page. 

  
  ## Bugs and Errors

- Solved

  - Instead of using a nav in the header I used a list attribute. I simply fixed this by putting the list into a nav tag.
  - I used H1 tags in subheadings. I changed those to h2 tags.
  - In the CSS stylesheet I doublewrote some code for both desktop and mobile devices. This slowed down the loading time. I changed this by deleting the code for mobile screens. 

- Unsolved bugs
    
  - None 

  ## Improvements of code 

- Implemented
   - Optimizing the photos for loading time on mobile devices. As the webiste is loading the desktop view first the photo in the apply page needed to be smaller on smaller screens to load faster. 
  
- To implement 
  - Make the application form work in the backend.
